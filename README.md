# Emulator Shiny Hunting Bot
## Automating Static Encounter Resets
### Created By Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://github.com/SirScrubbington))

## Description

This is a simple shiny hunting bot that uses a virtual controller in Python and an emulator to automate resetting static encounters in Pokémon games.
The bot detects shiny encounters by measuring the delay between the start of a battle and the availability of the menu. Shiny encounters make this delay longer!

While the bot is reliable, there are some cases where it may get stuck. However, the bot is designed to detect these situations and reset to continue shiny hunting. 
Planned future updates include support for hatching bots and additional games.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/damon-murdoch/emu-shiny-hunting-bot.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash

3. Ensure you have the required emulator installed.
4. Run the script to start the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the bot by running the script. The bot will search for the emulator window on your desktop.
2. Select from the available bot options:
   - Static Encounter Bot
   - Egg Hatcher (XY, ORAS, SM/USUM) – *Coming Soon!*
3. The bot will take a screenshot of the game window for confirmation before proceeding with shiny hunting.
4. The bot will reset the game automatically upon non-shiny encounters and continue until a shiny is found.

## Future Changes

- Adding support for egg hatching in various Pokémon games.
- Improving shiny detection accuracy.
- Implementing support for more games beyond the Pokémon series.
